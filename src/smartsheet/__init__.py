Smartsheet API Integration Package

This package provides integration with the Smartsheet API for retrieving
and processing compliance data. It includes a client for API communication
and data models for representing Smartsheet resources.

Key Components:
- SmartsheetClient: Client for API communication with error handling
- Workspace: Data model for Smartsheet workspaces
- Sheet: Data model for Smartsheet sheets with columns and rows

This package serves as the interface between the application and Smartsheet,
isolating API-specific details and providing a consistent data structure
for downstream processing.
